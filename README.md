## Weather CLI 

A program that have an API call for [`OpenWeather`](https://openweathermap.org/guide), and accepts any given city. 

-   Using `axios`
-   My own `API KEY`
-   Displays the degrees also in Fahrenheit.

Reference to output:

```bash
$ node src/index.js berlin
It is now 18.89Â°C in Berlin, DE
The current weather conditions are: few clouds
```
